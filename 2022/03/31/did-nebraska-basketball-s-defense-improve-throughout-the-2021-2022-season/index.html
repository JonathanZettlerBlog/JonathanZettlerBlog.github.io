<p>It’s no secret that Nebraska had a rough basketball season this year going 10-22
overall and 4-16 in the Big Ten. The team continued to drop games because of
poor defense, but did the Cornhuskers defense improve at all throughout the
season?</p>
<p>Defense clearly was a struggle for the team as many fans pointed out that
opposing teams would have their best shooting nights against the Cornhuskers.
Did Nebraska’s opponents really shoot that well against them?</p>
<p>To get a good look at how Nebraska’s defense changed throughout the season, I
made line chart of how Nebraska’s opponents true shooting was against them over
the course of the season.</p>

<p>Forcing turnovers is a huge part of good defensive basketball, specifically
getting steals. This scatterplot below gives you a good look at how many steals
Nebraska’s defense got against each team over the course of the season to see
whether or not they improved or got worse with steals over the season.</p>

As you can see, the Huskers did not show any improvement in forcing their
opponents to turn the ball over. While they had more steals in their last game
than their first game, they did not show any consistent improvement in steals
throughout the season.</p>
<p>Rim protection is an important part in having a good defense. This unique
Circular Bar Chart below shows you how many blocks Nebraska’s defense had each
game throughout the course of the season.</p>
