      <description>It’s no secret that Nebraska had a rough basketball season this year going 10-22 overall and 4-16 in the Big Ten. The team continued to drop games because of poor defense, but did the Cornhuskers defense improve at all throughout the season?
Defense clearly was a struggle for the team as many fans pointed out that opposing teams would have their best shooting nights against the Cornhuskers. Did Nebraska’s opponents really shoot that well against them?</description>
